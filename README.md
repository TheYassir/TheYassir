### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm not Yassir but The Yassir

I am a junior developer, the best of them, studying at O'clock in the Minotaur class !

My current stack is composed of PHP\Symfony Python\Django and the basics (HTML | CSS | JS)

I work with VSCode and AWS Cloud9

A talent in design that I was able to create a complete library: Bootstrap

During this year, I will add to my stack: React / Node / Laravel / Flutter to finally become an accomplished full-stack developer.

My greatest talent is to make hello world app in many languages and my worst fault too.
